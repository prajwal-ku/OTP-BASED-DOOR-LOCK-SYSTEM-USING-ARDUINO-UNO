An OTP-based door lock system is a modern
security mechanism that utilizes unique One-Time Passwords
for secure access. It comprises a microcontroller, GSM module,
LCD display, keypad, and solenoid lock. The user enters their
mobile number, receives an OTP, and upon successful
verification, the door is unlocked. The system is cost-effective,
easy to use, and can be installed in various applications for
high-security levels. Overall, the OTP-based door lock system
provides an efficient alternative to traditional lock-and-key
mechanisms for securing access to restricted areas.
